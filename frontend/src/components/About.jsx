        I’m a Computer Science student with hands-on experience in AI/ML workflows, image annotation, Python development, and
        software troubleshooting. I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming, and
        I’m excited to contribute to real-world projects as a Software Development or ML Engineering Intern.

        I also earned an Associate of Science in Computer Science from MassBay Community College, Wellesley, MA in May 2025,
        graduating as Valedictorian. During my time at MassBay, I earned the Program Award in Computer Science, the All-College
        Academic Excellence Award, and the Impact Award for my contributions to the college community.

        Outside of coding, I love hiking, exploring new trails, and playing snooker. I’m always looking for new challenges, both
        in and out of the lab.
